	abstract = {Abstract
            More than 4 million adults survive a stay in the intensive care unit each year, with many experiencing new or worsening physical disability, mental health problems, and/or cognitive impairments, known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Given the prevalence and magnitude of physical impairments after critical illness, many survivors, including those recovering from COVID-19, could benefit from physical therapist services after hospital discharge. However, due to the relatively recent recognition and characterization of PICS, there may be limited awareness and understanding of PICS among physical therapists practicing in home health care and community-based settings. This lack of awareness may lead to inappropriate and/or inadequate rehabilitation service provision. While this perspective article provides information relevant to all physical therapists, it is aimed toward those providing rehabilitation services outside of the acute and postacute inpatient settings. This article reports the prevalence and clinical presentation of PICS and provides recommendations for physical examination and outcomes measures, plan of care, and intervention strategies. The importance of providing patient and family education, coordinating community resources including referring to other health care team members, and community-based rehabilitation service options is emphasized. Finally, this perspective article discusses current challenges for optimizing outcomes for people with PICS and suggests future directions for research and practice.},

	abstract = {Background
              The relationship between muscle function in critically ill patients assessed using bedside techniques and clinical outcomes has not been systematically described. We aimed to evaluate the association between muscle weakness assessed by bedside evaluation and mortality or weaning from mechanical ventilation, and the capacity of each evaluation tool to predict outcomes.
            
            
              Methods
              Five databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Science Direct) were searched from January 2000 to December 2018. Data were extracted and random effects meta-analyses were performed.
            
            
              Results
              60 studies were analysed, including 4382 patients. Intensive care unit (ICU)-related muscle weakness was associated with an increase in overall mortality with odds ratios ranging from 1.2 (95\% CI 0.60–2.40) to 4.48 (95\% CI 1.49–13.42). Transdiaphragmatic twitch pressure had the highest predictive capacity for overall mortality, with a sensitivity of 0.87 (95\% CI 0.76–0.93) and a specificity of 0.36 (95\% CI 0.27–0.43). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.74 (95\% CI 0.70–0.78). Muscle weakness was associated with an increase in mechanical ventilation weaning failure rate with an odds ratio ranging from 2.64 (95\% CI 0.72–9.64) to 19.07 (95\% CI 9.35–38.9). Diaphragm thickening fraction had the highest predictive capacity for weaning failure with a sensitivity of 0.76 (95\% CI 0.67–0.83) and a specificity of 0.86 (95\% CI 0.78–0.92). The AUC was 0.86 (95\% CI 0.83–0.89).
            
            
              Conclusion
              ICU-related muscle weakness detected by bedside techniques is a serious issue associated with a high risk of death or prolonged mechanical ventilation. Evaluating diaphragm function should be a clinical priority in the ICU.},

	abstract = {Background
              Early physical rehabilitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been shown to improve short-term clinical outcomes but long-term benefit has not been proven and the optimum intensity of rehabilitation is not known.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a randomised, parallel-group, allocation-concealed, assessor-blinded, controlled trial in patients who had received at least 48 hours of invasive or non-invasive ventilation. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by admitting ICU, admission type and level of independence. The intervention group had a target of 90 min physical rehabilitation per day, the control group a target of 30 min per day (both Monday to Friday). The primary outcome was the Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure of SF-36 at 6 months.
            
            
              Results
              We recruited 308 participants over 34 months: 150 assigned to the intervention and 158 to the control group. The intervention group received a median (IQR) of 161 (67–273) min of physical rehabilitation on ICU compared with 86 (31–139) min in the control group. At 6 months, 62 participants in the intervention group and 54 participants in the control group contributed primary outcome data. In the intervention group, 43 had died, 11 had withdrawn and 34 were lost to follow-up, while in the control group, 56 had died, 5 had withdrawn and 43 were lost to follow-up. There was no difference in the primary outcome at 6 months, mean (SD) PCS 37 (12.2) in the intervention group and 37 (11.3) in the control group.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In this study, ICU-based physical rehabilitation did not appear to improve physical outcomes at 6 months compared with standard physical rehabilitation.

	abstract = {Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) can develop a condition referred to as “ICU-acquired weakness.” This condition is characterized by profound weakness that is greater than might be expected to result from prolonged bed rest. Intensive care unit–acquired weakness often is accompanied by dysfunction of multiple organ systems. Individuals with ICU-acquired weakness typically have significant activity limitations, often requiring physical assistance for even the most basic activities associated with bed mobility. Many of these individuals have activity limitations months to years after hospitalization. The purpose of this article is to review evidence that guides physical rehabilitation of people with ICU-acquired weakness. Included are diagnostic criteria, medical management, and prognostic indicators, as well as criteria for beginning physical rehabilitation, with an emphasis on patient safety. Data are presented indicating that rehabilitation can be implemented with very few adverse effects. Evidence is provided for appropriate measurement approaches and for physical intervention strategies. Finally, some of the key issues are summarized that should be investigated to determine the best intervention guidelines for individuals with ICU-acquired weakness.},
